    """Greetings! I am currently a Computer Science graduate student attending the University of Central Florida. My productive spare-time hobbies include full-stack development on web, mobile, and game applications. I am in graduate school because of an interest in AI. I am fascinated by how AI will shape the future of our society; as a result, I am trying to get a more in-depth understanding of the applications of AI. I currently work as a graduate research student at UCF. I am currently focusing my research efforts on building the software for an assistive robot using OpenCV in C++. With this experience, I have gained the skills needed incorporate such applications & concepts into my personal projects, and leverage such skills to contribute in the software idustry.""";

Hello! Welcome to my website! Everything you see is created by me from scratch using Flutter web!

I chose Flutter web over other frameworks for a few reasons:
- Flutter's coding architecture is more intuitive to my understanding and recall
- The design is the same as that of Flutter mobile
- I can just focus on using the programming language for building the UI and application logic instead of trying to juggle with many different tools like css, scss, jquery, etc. to get the same job done

These features are so handy that I have decided to try writing a blog (hence this first post). I will most likely write mainly about programming and programming-adjacent topics, but I may occasionally dip into other subjects if something catches my attention.
